# Review Quentin Degli-Esposti

"Quentin's project is well-structured, and I was able to start it without any issues thanks to his README.md file.  
I executed all the requested queries for practice; there was only one that didn't work. It involved deleting a beer photo, and the error returned was about a foreign key on the 'brewery' table. I'm not sure I fully understand the connection between these tables.  
Otherwise, it's a good piece of work. :)"
